  aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. 
  This workshop is designed for researchers and enables non-experts to develop computing skills for research analysis. We will cover 
  basic concepts and tools, such as - working with libraries and data frames; reading and plotting data; creating and using functions; 
  the shell using command-line applications; cleaning and transforming data; and more. Participants will be encouraged to help one another 
  and to apply what they This is a free workshop and is open to all University of California students, staff, and faculty.
